HydraFlow-X HFT
Ultra-low-latency C++ DeFi HFT engine for adversarial execution, oracle-lag arbitrage, sequencer-queue alpha, and liquidity-epoch microstructure edges. Deterministic timing, kernel-bypass networking, private builders, and cross-venue hedging.

Vision
Exploit predictable, repeatable microstructure edges in DeFi at HFT speeds:

Oracle catch-up arbitrage on lending/derivative protocols with delta-neutral hedges.

Sequencer queue and builder inclusion probability arbitrage with private orderflow.

Liquidity “breathing” around incentive epochs and ve-token rebalances.

Benign backruns and latency arbitrage using opt-in flow and private relays.
The system is built in modern C++ with explicit CPU cache/NUMA control, RDMA, kernel-bypass, and a deterministic event loop, reflecting an HFT-grade approach.

Core Principles
Determinism over throughput: no moving GC, no dynamic allocations on hot path.

Network first: minimize wire-to-wire latency; preconnect, pin cores, bypass kernel.

Risk-first: atomic DAG execution with bounded loss, hedges before slow legs.

Adversarial modeling: treat sequencers, builders, and oracles as strategic actors.

Auditability: every decision logged with signal attributions for fast iteration.

Alpha Overview
Oracle Skew Arbitrage

Detect stale TWAP/oracle feeds vs. fast market mid (perps/CEFI reference).

Enter delta-neutral positions ahead of oracle push; unwind post-update.

EV must cover gas + builder fee + slippage + failover penalties.

Sequencer Queue Alpha

Model inclusion probability P(inclusion|tip, builder, block_height) per relay.

Submit optimal bundles to private builders; cancel/replace on adverse queue shifts.

Capture backruns on price-impacting intents with opt-in flow only.

Liquidity Epoch Breathing

Anticipate LP migration at epoch flips; buy during temporary spread widening.

Exit as inventory rebalances; hedge via perps to keep inventory neutral.

Architecture
hfx-core: lock-free event engine; time wheel; state snapshots.

hfx-net: DPDK/AF_XDP transport; QUIC for builder APIs; TLS offload optional.

hfx-chain: light clients for L2s (Optimism/Arbitrum), private relays, builder RPC.

hfx-mempool: streaming mempool/sequencer queue; intent feed parsers.

hfx-mm: market models (gas->inclusion s-curve, slippage models, queue risk).

hfx-strat: strategies: oracle-arb, queue-arb, epoch-breathing.

hfx-hedge: cross-venue hedger (perps/AMMs/CEFI), atomic DAG executor.

hfx-risk: limits, circuit-breakers, drawdown guards, anomaly detectors.

hfx-log: binary journaling, attribution, post-trade analytics.

Data Flow
Wire ingest (ticks, mempool, builder tips) -> Event engine

Signal calc (oracle skew, inclusion probability, LP migration) -> Strategy

Strategy emits DAG: [approve]->[swap]->[hedge]->[settle]

Executor compiles bundles per relay with gas/tip curves

Hedge leg fires first on fastest venue; main leg atomic or bounded by timeouts

Attribution marks signals used; logs to binary WAL.

Deterministic Event Loop
Single-writer principle per hot component

Lock-free ring buffers; fixed-capacity pools; preallocated objects

NUMA pinning: NIC queue -> core -> cache locality

RT priority; TSC clock; PPS/GPS sync optional for drift control.

Latency Targets (wire-to-fill, 99p)
Private relay submission: 300–900 µs (L2), 2–5 ms (L1)

Hedge on fast perp venue: 1–3 ms

Oracle skew detection to order emit: <200 µs on hot path

Cancel/replace on adverse queue shift: <400 µs end-to-end.

Strategy Specs
Oracle Skew Arbitrage
Signal: skew = mid_fast - price_oracle; threshold θ_t adaptive by volatility.

Positioning: long undervalued/short overvalued legs, hedge delta at perp.

Exit: on oracle update or σ-normalization; hard timeout τ.

EV: E = |skew| * size - fees - slippage - failure_cost; require E > E_min.

Risk: oracle jump-ahead, partial fills, builder failure -> priced into E.

Sequencer Queue Arb / Benign Backruns
Observe pending intents causing price impact Δ.

Compute P_win per builder given tip curve; choose bundle split to maximize EV.

Constraints: benign policies only; no harmful sandwich; opt-in flow tags required.

Failover: if builder drops, switch relay; cap retries; update P_win stats.

Liquidity Epoch Breathing
Predict LP out/in flows at epoch boundaries; model transient spread widening.

Enter inventory-light arb; hedge with perps; unwind as spreads normalize.

Abort if realized slippage > bound or LP migration deviates.

Risk Management
Hard limits: per-edge notional, per-chain VaR, per-venue exposure.

Drawdown halts: edge-class DD10%/day or 3×σ events trigger cool-off.

Revert rate guard: if revert% > r_max over N trades -> pause strategy.

Builder anomaly: variance in inclusion vs. model -> quarantine builder.

Oracle anomaly: update cadence/jump > kσ -> disable oracle-arb.

Capital Allocation
Online performance attribution per edge and venue

Ridge-regularized weights; weekly half-life decay to avoid regime lock-in

Capacity curve per edge; throttle as slippage grows; prioritize highest EV per ms.

Build/Run
C++20, clang-17+, -O3 -march=native -fno-exceptions on hot code

Link-time optimization, PGO; Jemalloc for cold-path allocations

DPDK/AF_XDP requires hugepages, NIC SR-IOV, core pinning

Config via static TOML; no dynamic reload on hot path.

Testing/Simulation

Latency harness: synthetic bursts; tail-latency histograms

Fault injection: builder drop, oracle jump, gas spike, reorg; verify kill-switches

Determinism tests: replay produces identical decisions bit-for-bit.

Telemetry and Logging
Binary journaling with nanosecond timestamps, compressed

Real-time metrics over UDP: p50/p99 latencies, P_win by builder, revert%

Post-trade attribution CSVs for research; strict schema for offline analysis.

Security/Ethics
Policy engine forbids toxic sandwiching; only benign backruns and opt-in flow

Secrets in HSM/YubiHSM; key ops off hot path; ephemeral session keys to builders

Audit trail maps every trade to signals and policies in effect.

Hardware

# Figure out a way (brainstrom ideas very advanced level breakthourgh blleding edge tech to run on this on macbook pro)

Compliance Note
Operates only on opt-in or public-flow benign opportunities; excludes exploitative behaviors

Regional regulations may apply for derivatives/CEFI hedges; configure venue allowlist.

Extensions
Rust sidecar for research/backtesting; FFI into C++ core

Solidity governance for policy toggles and risk caps

LLM offline agent to generate hypothesis tests and stress scenarios; not on hot path.

Success Metrics
Net basis captured per strategy after all costs

Tail loss per 10K trades < threshold; revert% below r_max

Wire-to-fill medians and p99 within targets; EV accuracy calibration error < ε

Weekly SR improvements via allocator without increasing tail risk.
